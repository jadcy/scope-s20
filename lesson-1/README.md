# **Lesson 1 - Introduction to Electron, Machine Setup, and Overview of Concepts**

## **Introduction**
**Welcome to Scope - Spring 2020!**

We're psyched to be teaching Electron this semester, a framework that allows you to develop native desktop applications with Javascript.  Essentially, Electron allows you to develop cross-platform desktop applications in the same way that you would create a website.  For anyone who's tried to create a desktop app... that's pretty freaking cool.

If you've ever created a website, you can get started developing Electron applications really quickly.  Knowing the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript are the main components of Electron, so if you have a firm handle on these, you're set!  If not, no worries, we will be going over the basics of these languages early on so everyone is caught up.  We will also be integrating more frameworks on top of Electron to create even more beautiful applications.

How is this different from building a website?  Why would we even want to do this?  While a very simple API, Electron is so much more than a web app.  It allows you to access the OS, read and write to the file system, and much more you wouldn't be able to do with just a website.  Let's go!

## **Setup**
Before we get started with the coding aspect, we need to get a few things set up.  First, make sure that you have a good text editor.  Scope's favorite (Julia's really, but who's doing curriculum) is Visual Studio Code.  It's incredible for debugging.  However, the new MacOS's no longer support it (sigh).  If you're running a different OS (or earlier Apple), get it here:
https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

Another good editor not supported by current macOS is Atom.  You can review them on your own time, get it here:
https://atom.io

For everyone running new macOS without a favorite editor, you can download Sublime for now.  Get it here:
https://www.sublimetext.com

Now, we are going to install npm (Node Package Manager).  If you've worked with any other Javascript frameworks before, chances are you already have this downloaded.  Go through these very simple steps to verify it's installed, or install from scratch.

To check, run: node -v in terminal
